These templates are copied from the OpenLEADR-python project.  That project is licensed under Apache2.

See: https://github.com/OpenLEADR/openleadr-python

In that project the templates were processed with Ninja2, a Python template processing engine.  For Node.js, these are processed using Nunjucks, because it is similar to Ninja2.  A few changes were made to the templates because of small differences between the two.
